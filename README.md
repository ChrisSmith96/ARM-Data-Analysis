# Data-Analysis
Technical Test

All findings and visualisations of the performance data can been found in the Data_Analysis.ipynb file developed in Jupyter Notebook. 
The suggested actions the development team should take are presented at the bottom of the document in the conclusion.
In practice the code in the document would be hidden for greater clarity, but in this case it has been left it visible.

If the ipynb file fails to render in GitHub (which appears to be a common problem), please download it and execute it using a more appropriate program. 
Please contact me if you have any problems and I shall do my best to help.
